electron-rebuild 3.2.9
MIT
## Electron Rebuild

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/electron/electron-rebuild.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/electron/electron-rebuild)
[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/electron-rebuild.svg?style=flat)](https://npm.im/electron-rebuild)
[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/electron/electron-rebuild/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/electron/electron-rebuild)

This executable rebuilds native Node.js modules against the version of Node.js
that your Electron project is using. This allows you to use native Node.js
modules in Electron apps without your system version of Node.js matching exactly
(which is often not the case, and sometimes not even possible).

### How does it work?

Install the package with `--save-dev`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild
```

Then, whenever you install a new npm package, rerun electron-rebuild:

```sh
$(npm bin)/electron-rebuild
```

Or if you're on Windows:

```sh
.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd
```
If you have a good node-gyp config but you see an error about a missing element on Windows like `Could not load the Visual C++ component "VCBuild.exe"`, try to launch electron-rebuild in an npm script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "rebuild": "electron-rebuild -f -w yourmodule"
}
```

and then

```sh
npm run rebuild
```

### What are the requirements?

Node v12.13.0 or higher is required. Building native modules from source uses
[`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation), refer to the link for its
installation/runtime requirements.

### CLI Arguments

```
Usage: electron-rebuild --version [version] --module-dir [path]

Options:
  -h, --help                   Show help                               [boolean]
  -v, --version                The version of Electron to build against
  -f, --force                  Force rebuilding modules, even if we would skip
                               it otherwise
  -a, --arch                   Override the target architecture to something
                               other than your system's
  -m, --module-dir             The path to the app directory to rebuild
  -w, --which-module           A specific module to build, or comma separated
                               list of modules. Modules will only be rebuilt if they
                               also match the types of dependencies being rebuilt
                               (see --types).
  -e, --electron-prebuilt-dir  The path to the prebuilt electron module
  -d, --dist-url               Custom header tarball URL
  -t, --types                  The types of dependencies to rebuild.  Comma
                               separated list of "prod", "dev" and "optional".
                               Default is "prod,optional"
  -p, --parallel               Rebuild in parallel, this is enabled by default
                               on macOS and Linux
  -s, --sequential             Rebuild modules sequentially, this is enabled by
                               default on Windows
  -o, --only                   Only build specified module, or comma separated
                               list of modules. All others are ignored.
  -b, --debug                  Build debug version of modules
  --prebuild-tag-prefix        GitHub tag prefix passed to prebuild-install.
                               Default is "v"

### How can I use this with [Electron Forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge)?

This package is automatically used with Electron Forge when packaging an Electron app.

### How can I integrate this into [Electron Packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager)?

electron-rebuild provides a function compatible with the [`afterCopy` hook](https://electron.github.io/electron-packager/main/interfaces/electronpackager.options.html#aftercopy)
for Electron Packager. For example:

```javascript
import packager from 'electron-packager';
import rebuild from 'electron-rebuild';

packager({
  // … other options
  afterCopy: [(buildPath, electronVersion, platform, arch, callback) => {
    rebuild({ buildPath, electronVersion, arch })
      .then(() => callback())
      .catch((error) => callback(error));
  }],
  // … other options
});
```

### How can I integrate this with [prebuild](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild)?

If your module uses [prebuild](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild) for creating prebuilt binaries,
it also uses [prebuild-install](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild-install) to download them. If
this is the case, then `electron-rebuild` will run `prebuild-install` to download the correct
binaries from the project's GitHub Releases instead of rebuilding them.

### How can I integrate this into Grunt / Gulp / Whatever?

electron-rebuild is also a library that you can require into your app or
build process. It has a very simple API:

```javascript
import rebuild from 'electron-rebuild';

// Public: Rebuilds a node_modules directory with the given Electron version.
//
// options: Object with the following properties
//     buildPath - An absolute path to your app's directory.  (The directory that contains your node_modules)
//     electronVersion - The version of Electron to rebuild for
//     arch (optional) - Default: process.arch - The arch to rebuild for
//     extraModules (optional) - Default: [] - An array of modules to rebuild as well as the detected modules
//     onlyModules (optional) - Default: null - An array of modules to rebuild, ONLY these module names will be rebuilt.
//                                              The "types" property will be ignored if this option is set.
//     force (optional) - Default: false - Force a rebuild of modules regardless of their current build state
//     headerURL (optional) - Default: https://www.electronjs.org/headers - The URL to download Electron header files from
//     types (optional) - Default: ['prod', 'optional'] - The types of modules to rebuild
//     mode (optional) - The rebuild mode, either 'sequential' or 'parallel' - Default varies per platform (probably shouldn't mess with this one)
//     useElectronClang (optional) - Whether to use the clang executable that Electron used when building its binary. This will guarantee compiler compatibility

// Returns a Promise indicating whether the operation succeeded or not
```

A full build process might look something like:

```javascript
const childProcess = require('child_process');
const pathToElectron = require('electron');

  rebuild({
    buildPath: __dirname,
    electronVersion: '1.4.12'
  })
    .then(() => console.info('Rebuild Successful'))
    .catch((e) => {
      console.error("Building modules didn't work!");
      console.error(e);
    });
```

### Alternatives

- [require-rebuild](https://github.com/juliangruber/require-rebuild) patches `require()` to rebuild native node modules on the fly

react-refresh-typescript 2.0.7
MIT
# react-refresh-typescript

This package currently matches the upstream runtime of [`react-refresh@0.13.*`](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/72b7462fe73ea2f7bc296bc58670baf9677ce8b2).

This package implements the plugin to integrate Fast Refresh into bundlers. Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in a running application without losing their state.

This package is primarily aimed at developers of bundler plugins. If you’re working on one, here is [a rough guide](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604#issuecomment-528663101) for Fast Refresh integration using this package.

## Minimal requirement

-   TypeScript 4.0
-   `module` (not `target`) set to `es2015` or later (not work with `CommonJS` currently. If you really need it, please vote in [#3](https://github.com/Jack-Works/react-refresh-transformer/issues/3))

## Example (with ts-loader)

```js
{
    test: /\.tsx?$/,
    loader: 'ts-loader',
    exclude: /node_modules/,
    options: {
        getCustomTransformers: () => ({
            before: [require('react-refresh-typescript')()]
        }),
    }
}
```

## Example (with raw TypeScript transpileModule API)

```js
import refresh from 'react-refresh-typescript';
import ts from 'typescript';
const out = ts.transpileModule('const App = () => <Something />', {
    compilerOptions: {
        target: ts.ScriptTarget.ESNext,
        jsx: ts.JsxEmit.Preserve,
    },
    fileName: 'test.jsx',
    transformers: {before: [refresh(options)]},
}).outputText,
```

## Import from Deno

The entry point is [`src/deno.ts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jack-Works/react-refresh-transformer/main/typescript/src/deno.ts).

You must have [an import map for deno](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_maps) that specify `typescript` as a peer dependency.

For example:

```json
{
    "imports": {
        "typescript": "https://esm.sh/typescript"
    }
}
```

### Without import-map

If you don't want to set up an import map, you can import [the core file](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-refresh-typescript@latest/dist-src/core.js) and provide TypeScript via `options.ts`.

## Options

```ts
export type Options = {
    /** @default "$RefreshReg$" */
    refreshReg?: string
    /** @default "$RefreshSig$" */
    refreshSig?: string
    /** @default false */
    emitFullSignatures?: boolean
    /** Provide your own TypeScript instance. */
    ts?: typeof import('typescript')
    /** Provide your own hash function when `emitFullSignatures` is `false` */
    hashSignature?: (signature: string) => string
}
```

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## Looking for v5?

The `main` branch is under development of the upcoming v6 major version of styled-components. For changes targeting v5, please point your PRs at the `legacy-v5` branch.

---

Utilizing [tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals) (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the [power of CSS](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#supported-css), `styled-components` allow you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  color: grey;
`;
```

Alternatively, you may use [style objects](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects). This allows for easy porting of CSS from inline styles, while still supporting the more advanced styled-components capabilities like component selectors and media queries.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button({
  color: 'grey',
});
```

Equivalent to:

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  color: grey;
`;
```

`styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the [documentation about React Native](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native) for more information.

_Supported by [Front End Center](https://frontend.center). Thank you for making this possible!_

## Upgrading from v4

1. `npm install styled-components@^5.0.0 react@^16.8 react-dom@^16.8 react-is@^16.8`
1. ??
1. Profit!

> If you use jest-styled-components, make sure you update that too.

## [Docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)

**See the documentation at [styled-components.com/docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)** for more information about using `styled-components`!

Quicklinks to some of the most-visited pages:

- [**Getting started**](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics)
- [API Reference](https://styled-components.com/docs/api)
- [Theming](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming)
- [Server-side rendering](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering)
- [Tagged Template Literals explained](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)

## Example

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```JSX
import React from 'react';

import styled from 'styled-components';

// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;

// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`;

// Use them like any other React component – except they're styled!
<Wrapper>
  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
</Wrapper>
```

  </a>
</div>

## Babel Macro

If you're using tooling that has babel-plugin-macros set up, you can switch to the `styled-components/macro` import path instead to gain the effects of the babel plugin without further setup.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components/macro';

// A static className will be generated for Title (important for SSR)
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
```

If you wish to provide configuration options to the babel plugin similar to how you would in a `.babelrc`, [see this guide](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/main/other/docs/author.md#config-experimental). The config name is `"styledComponents"`.

## Built with `styled-components`

A lot of hard work goes into community libraries, projects, and guides. A lot of them make it easier to get started or help you with your next project! There are also a whole lot of interesting apps and sites that people have built using styled-components.

Make sure to head over to [awesome-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components) to see them all! And please contribute and add your own work to the list so others can find it.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to `styled-components` please see our [contributing and community guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md), they'll help you get set up locally and explain the whole process.

TypeORM is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms
and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8).
Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features
that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from
small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications
with multiple databases.

TypeORM supports both [Active Record](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) and [Data Mapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) patterns,
unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence,
which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable,
maintainable applications the most productive way.

TypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/),
[Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

## Features

-   Supports both [DataMapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) and [ActiveRecord](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) (your choice).
-   Entities and columns.
-   Database-specific column types.
-   Entity manager.
-   Repositories and custom repositories.
-   Clean object relational model.
-   Associations (relations).
-   Eager and lazy relations.
-   Uni-directional, bi-directional and self-referenced relations.
-   Supports multiple inheritance patterns.
-   Cascades.
-   Indices.
-   Transactions.
-   Migrations and automatic migrations generation.
-   Connection pooling.
-   Replication.
-   Using multiple database instances.
-   Working with multiple databases types.
-   Cross-database and cross-schema queries.
-   Elegant-syntax, flexible and powerful QueryBuilder.
-   Left and inner joins.
-   Proper pagination for queries using joins.
-   Query caching.
-   Streaming raw results.
-   Logging.
-   Listeners and subscribers (hooks).
-   Supports closure table pattern.
-   Schema declaration in models or separate configuration files.
-   Connection configuration in json / xml / yml / env formats.
-   Supports MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / CockroachDB / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / SAP Hana / sql.js.
-   Supports MongoDB NoSQL database.
-   Works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / React Native / NativeScript / Expo / Electron platforms.
-   TypeScript and JavaScript support.
-   ESM and CommonJS support.
-   Produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable.
-   Follows all possible best practices.
-   CLI.

And more...

With TypeORM your models look like this:

```javascript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    firstName: string

    @Column()
    lastName: string

    @Column()
    age: number
}
```

And your domain logic looks like this:

```javascript
const userRepository = MyDataSource.getRepository(User)

const user = new User()
user.firstName = "Timber"
user.lastName = "Saw"
user.age = 25
await userRepository.save(user)

const allUsers = await userRepository.find()
const firstUser = await userRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
}) // find by id
const timber = await userRepository.findOneBy({
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Saw",
}) // find by firstName and lastName

await userRepository.remove(timber)
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use the `ActiveRecord` implementation, you can use it as well:

```javascript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, BaseEntity } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class User extends BaseEntity {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    firstName: string

    @Column()
    lastName: string

    @Column()
    age: number
}
```

And your domain logic will look this way:

```javascript
const user = new User()
user.firstName = "Timber"
user.lastName = "Saw"
user.age = 25
await user.save()

const allUsers = await User.find()
const firstUser = await User.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
const timber = await User.findOneBy({
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Saw"
})

await timber.remove()
```

## Installation

1. Install the npm package:

    `npm install typeorm --save`

2. You need to install `reflect-metadata` shim:

    `npm install reflect-metadata --save`

    and import it somewhere in the global place of your app (for example in `app.ts`):

    `import "reflect-metadata"`

3. You may need to install node typings:

    `npm install @types/node --save-dev`

4. Install a database driver:

    - for **MySQL** or **MariaDB**

        `npm install mysql --save` (you can install `mysql2` instead as well)

    - for **PostgreSQL** or **CockroachDB**

        `npm install pg --save`

    - for **SQLite**

        `npm install sqlite3 --save`

    - for **Microsoft SQL Server**

        `npm install mssql --save`

    - for **sql.js**

        `npm install sql.js --save`

    - for **Oracle**

        `npm install oracledb --save`

        To make the Oracle driver work, you need to follow the installation instructions from
        [their](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb) site.

    - for **SAP Hana**

        ```
        npm install @sap/hana-client
        npm install hdb-pool
        ```

        _SAP Hana support made possible by the sponsorship of [Neptune Software](https://www.neptune-software.com/)._

    - for **Google Cloud Spanner**

        ```
        npm install @google-cloud/spanner --save
        ```

        Provide authentication credentials to your application code
        by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:

        ```shell
        # Linux/macOS
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

        # Windows
        set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=KEY_PATH

        # Replace KEY_PATH with the path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.
        ```

        To use Spanner with the emulator you should set `SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable:

        ```shell
        # Linux/macOS
        export SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010

        # Windows
        set SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010
        ```

    - for **MongoDB** (experimental)

        `npm install mongodb@^3.6.0 --save`

    - for **NativeScript**, **react-native** and **Cordova**

        Check [documentation of supported platforms](./docs/supported-platforms.md)

    Install only _one_ of them, depending on which database you use.

##### TypeScript configuration

Also, make sure you are using TypeScript version **4.5** or higher,
and you have enabled the following settings in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
"experimentalDecorators": true,
```

You may also need to enable `es6` in the `lib` section of compiler options, or install `es6-shim` from `@types`.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with TypeORM is to use its CLI commands to generate a starter project.
Quick start works only if you are using TypeORM in a NodeJS application.
If you are using other platforms, proceed to the [step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide).

To create a new project using CLI, run the following command:

```shell
npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres
```

Where `name` is the name of your project and `database` is the database you'll use.
Database can be one of the following values: `mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `sap`, `spanner`, `oracle`, `mongodb`,
`cordova`, `react-native`, `expo`, `nativescript`.

This command will generate a new project in the `MyProject` directory with the following files:

```
MyProject
├── src                   // place of your TypeScript code
│   ├── entity            // place where your entities (database models) are stored
│   │   └── User.ts       // sample entity
│   ├── migration         // place where your migrations are stored
│   ├── data-source.ts    // data source and all connection configuration
│   └── index.ts          // start point of your application
├── .gitignore            // standard gitignore file
├── package.json          // node module dependencies
├── README.md             // simple readme file
└── tsconfig.json         // TypeScript compiler options
```

> You can also run `typeorm init` on an existing node project, but be careful - it may override some files you already have.

The next step is to install new project dependencies:

```shell
cd MyProject
npm install
```

After you have all dependencies installed, edit the `data-source.ts` file and put your own database connection configuration options in there:

```ts
export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    username: "test",
    password: "test",
    database: "test",
    synchronize: true,
    logging: true,
    entities: [Post, Category],
    subscribers: [],
    migrations: [],
})
```

Particularly, most of the time you'll only need to configure
`host`, `username`, `password`, `database` and maybe `port` options.

Once you finish with configuration and all node modules are installed, you can run your application:

```shell
npm start
```

That's it, your application should successfully run and insert a new user into the database.
You can continue to work with this project and integrate other modules you need and start
creating more entities.

> You can generate an ESM project by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --module esm` command.

> You can generate an even more advanced project with express installed by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database mysql --express` command.

> You can generate a docker-compose file by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --docker` command.

## Step-by-Step Guide

What are you expecting from ORM?
First of all, you are expecting it will create database tables for you
and find / insert / update / delete your data without the pain of
having to write lots of hardly maintainable SQL queries.
This guide will show you how to set up TypeORM from scratch and make it do what you are expecting from an ORM.

### Create a model

Working with a database starts from creating tables.
How do you tell TypeORM to create a database table?
The answer is - through the models.
Your models in your app are your database tables.

For example, you have a `Photo` model:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    id: number
    name: string
    description: string
    filename: string
    views: number
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

And you want to store photos in your database.
To store things in the database, first, you need a database table,
and database tables are created from your models.
Not all models, but only those you define as _entities_.

### Create an entity

_Entity_ is your model decorated by an `@Entity` decorator.
A database table will be created for such models.
You work with entities everywhere in TypeORM.
You can load/insert/update/remove and perform other operations with them.

Let's make our `Photo` model an entity:

```javascript
import { Entity } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    id: number
    name: string
    description: string
    filename: string
    views: number
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Now, a database table will be created for the `Photo` entity and we'll be able to work with it anywhere in our app.
We have created a database table, however, what table can exist without columns?
Let's create few columns in our database table.

### Adding table columns

To add database columns, you simply need to decorate an entity's properties you want to make into a column
with a `@Column` decorator.

```javascript
import { Entity, Column } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @Column()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Now `id`, `name`, `description`, `filename`, `views` and `isPublished` columns will be added to the `photo` table.
Column types in the database are inferred from the property types you used, e.g.
`number` will be converted into `integer`, `string` into `varchar`, `boolean` into `bool`, etc.
But you can use any column type your database supports by explicitly specifying a column type into the `@Column` decorator.

We generated a database table with columns, but there is one thing left.
Each database table must have a column with a primary key.

### Creating a primary column

Each entity **must** have at least one primary key column.
This is a requirement and you can't avoid it.
To make a column a primary key, you need to use the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator.

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

### Creating an auto-generated column

Now, let's say you want your id column to be auto-generated (this is known as auto-increment / sequence / serial / generated identity column).
To do that, you need to change the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator to a `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorator:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

### Column data types

Next, let's fix our data types. By default, the string is mapped to a varchar(255)-like type (depending on the database type).
The number is mapped to an integer-like type (depending on the database type).
We don't want all our columns to be limited varchars or integers.
Let's setup correct data types:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column({
        length: 100,
    })
    name: string

    @Column("text")
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column("double")
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Column types are database-specific.
You can set any column type your database supports.
More information on supported column types can be found [here](./docs/entities.md#column-types).

### Creating a new `DataSource`

Now, when our entity is created, let's create `index.ts` file and set up our `DataSource` there:

```javascript
import "reflect-metadata"
import { DataSource } from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"

const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    username: "root",
    password: "admin",
    database: "test",
    entities: [Photo],
    synchronize: true,
    logging: false,
})

// to initialize initial connection with the database, register all entities
// and "synchronize" database schema, call "initialize()" method of a newly created database
// once in your application bootstrap
AppDataSource.initialize()
    .then(() => {
        // here you can start to work with your database
    })
    .catch((error) => console.log(error))
```

We are using Postgres in this example, but you can use any other supported database.
To use another database, simply change the `type` in the options to the database type you are using:
`mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `oracle`, `sap`, `spanner`, `cordova`, `nativescript`, `react-native`,
`expo`, or `mongodb`.
Also make sure to use your own host, port, username, password and database settings.

We added our Photo entity to the list of entities for this data source.
Each entity you are using in your connection must be listed there.

Setting `synchronize` makes sure your entities will be synced with the database, every time you run the application.

### Running the application

Now if you run your `index.ts`, a connection with the database will be initialized and a database table for your photos will be created.

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(100) |                            |
| description | text         |                            |
| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |
| views       | int(11)      |                            |
| isPublished | boolean      |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Creating and inserting a photo into the database

Now let's create a new photo to save it in the database:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

await AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)
console.log("Photo has been saved. Photo id is", photo.id)
```

Once your entity is saved it will get a newly generated id.
`save` method returns an instance of the same object you pass to it.
It's not a new copy of the object, it modifies its "id" and returns it.

### Using Entity Manager

We just created a new photo and saved it in the database.
We used `EntityManager` to save it.
Using entity manager you can manipulate any entity in your app.
For example, let's load our saved entity:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const savedPhotos = await AppDataSource.manager.find(Photo)
console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos)
```

`savedPhotos` will be an array of Photo objects with the data loaded from the database.

Learn more about EntityManager [here](./docs/working-with-entity-manager.md).

### Using Repositories

Now let's refactor our code and use `Repository` instead of `EntityManager`.
Each entity has its own repository which handles all operations with its entity.
When you deal with entities a lot, Repositories are more convenient to use than EntityManagers:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)

await photoRepository.save(photo)
console.log("Photo has been saved")

const savedPhotos = await photoRepository.find()
console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos)
```

Learn more about Repository [here](./docs/working-with-repository.md).

### Loading from the database

Let's try more load operations using the Repository:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const allPhotos = await photoRepository.find()
console.log("All photos from the db: ", allPhotos)

const firstPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
console.log("First photo from the db: ", firstPhoto)

const meAndBearsPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    name: "Me and Bears",
})
console.log("Me and Bears photo from the db: ", meAndBearsPhoto)

const allViewedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ views: 1 })
console.log("All viewed photos: ", allViewedPhotos)

const allPublishedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ isPublished: true })
console.log("All published photos: ", allPublishedPhotos)

const [photos, photosCount] = await photoRepository.findAndCount()
console.log("All photos: ", photos)
console.log("Photos count: ", photosCount)
```

### Updating in the database

Now let's load a single photo from the database, update it and save it:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photoToUpdate = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
photoToUpdate.name = "Me, my friends and polar bears"
await photoRepository.save(photoToUpdate)
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be updated in the database.

### Removing from the database

Now let's remove our photo from the database:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photoToRemove = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
await photoRepository.remove(photoToRemove)
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be removed from the database.

### Creating a one-to-one relation

Let's create a one-to-one relationship with another class.
Let's create a new class in `PhotoMetadata.ts`. This PhotoMetadata class is supposed to contain our photo's additional meta-information:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column("int")
    height: number

    @Column("int")
    width: number

    @Column()
    orientation: string

    @Column()
    compressed: boolean

    @Column()
    comment: string

    @OneToOne(() => Photo)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo
}
```

Here, we are using a new decorator called `@OneToOne`. It allows us to create a one-to-one relationship between two entities.
`type => Photo` is a function that returns the class of the entity with which we want to make our relationship.
We are forced to use a function that returns a class, instead of using the class directly, because of the language specifics.
We can also write it as `() => Photo`, but we use `type => Photo` as a convention to increase code readability.
The type variable itself does not contain anything.

We also add a `@JoinColumn` decorator, which indicates that this side of the relationship will own the relationship.
Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Only one side of relational can be owning.
Using `@JoinColumn` decorator is required on the owner side of the relationship.

If you run the app, you'll see a newly generated table, and it will contain a column with a foreign key for the photo relation:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                     photo_metadata                      |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| height      | int(11)      |                            |
| width       | int(11)      |                            |
| comment     | varchar(255) |                            |
| compressed  | boolean      |                            |
| orientation | varchar(255) |                            |
| photoId     | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Save a one-to-one relation

Now let's save a photo, its metadata and attach them to each other.

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"

// create a photo
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

// create a photo metadata
const metadata = new PhotoMetadata()
metadata.height = 640
metadata.width = 480
metadata.compressed = true
metadata.comment = "cybershoot"
metadata.orientation = "portrait"
metadata.photo = photo // this way we connect them

// get entity repositories
const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const metadataRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(PhotoMetadata)

// first we should save a photo
await photoRepository.save(photo)

// photo is saved. Now we need to save a photo metadata
await metadataRepository.save(metadata)

// done
console.log(
    "Metadata is saved, and the relation between metadata and photo is created in the database too",
)
```

### Inverse side of the relationship

Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Currently, our relation between PhotoMetadata and Photo is unidirectional.
The owner of the relation is PhotoMetadata, and Photo doesn't know anything about PhotoMetadata.
This makes it complicated to access PhotoMetadata from the Photo side.
To fix this issue we should add an inverse relation, and make relations between PhotoMetadata and Photo bidirectional.
Let's modify our entities:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo
}
```

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne } from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)
    metadata: PhotoMetadata
}
```

`photo => photo.metadata` is a function that returns the name of the inverse side of the relation.
Here we show that the metadata property of the Photo class is where we store PhotoMetadata in the Photo class.
Instead of passing a function that returns a property of the photo, you could alternatively simply pass a string to `@OneToOne` decorator, like `"metadata"`.
But we used this function-typed approach to make our refactoring easier.

Note that we should use the `@JoinColumn` decorator only on one side of a relation.
Whichever side you put this decorator on will be the owning side of the relationship.
The owning side of a relationship contains a column with a foreign key in the database.

### Relations in ESM projects

If you use ESM in your TypeScript project, you should use the `Relation` wrapper type in relation properties to avoid circular dependency issues.
Let's modify our entities:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
    Relation,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Relation<Photo>
}
```

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    Relation,
} from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)
    metadata: Relation<PhotoMetadata>
}
```

### Loading objects with their relations

Now let's load our photo and its photo metadata in a single query.
There are two ways to do it - using `find*` methods or using `QueryBuilder` functionality.
Let's use `find*` methods first.
`find*` methods allow you to specify an object with the `FindOneOptions` / `FindManyOptions` interface.

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photos = await photoRepository.find({
    relations: {
        metadata: true,
    },
})
```

Here, photos will contain an array of photos from the database, and each photo will contain its photo metadata.
Learn more about Find Options in [this documentation](./docs/find-options.md).

Using find options is good and dead simple, but if you need a more complex query, you should use `QueryBuilder` instead.
`QueryBuilder` allows more complex queries to be used in an elegant way:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
    .createQueryBuilder("photo")
    .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
    .getMany()
```

`QueryBuilder` allows the creation and execution of SQL queries of almost any complexity.
When you work with `QueryBuilder`, think like you are creating an SQL query.
In this example, "photo" and "metadata" are aliases applied to selected photos.
You use aliases to access columns and properties of the selected data.

### Using cascades to automatically save related objects

We can set up cascade options in our relations, in the cases when we want our related object to be saved whenever the other object is saved.
Let's change our photo's `@OneToOne` decorator a bit:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    // ... other columns

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (metadata) => metadata.photo, {
        cascade: true,
    })
    metadata: PhotoMetadata
}
```

Using `cascade` allows us not to separately save photo and separately save metadata objects now.
Now we can simply save a photo object, and the metadata object will be saved automatically because of cascade options.

```javascript
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

// create photo object
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.isPublished = true

// create photo metadata object
const metadata = new PhotoMetadata()
metadata.height = 640
metadata.width = 480
metadata.compressed = true
metadata.comment = "cybershoot"
metadata.orientation = "portrait"

photo.metadata = metadata // this way we connect them

// get repository
const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)

// saving a photo also save the metadata
await photoRepository.save(photo)

console.log("Photo is saved, photo metadata is saved too.")
```

Notice that we now set the photo's `metadata` property, instead of the metadata's `photo` property as before. The `cascade` feature only works if you connect the photo to its metadata from the photo's side. If you set the metadata's side, the metadata would not be saved automatically.

### Creating a many-to-one / one-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-one/one-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo has one author, and each author can have many photos.
First, let's create an `Author` class:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToMany,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class Author {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @OneToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.author) // note: we will create author property in the Photo class below
    photos: Photo[]
}
```

`Author` contains an inverse side of a relation.
`OneToMany` is always an inverse side of the relation, and it can't exist without `ManyToOne` on the other side of the relation.

Now let's add the owner side of the relation into the Photo entity:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne } from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"
import { Author } from "./Author"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @ManyToOne(() => Author, (author) => author.photos)
    author: Author
}
```

In many-to-one / one-to-many relation, the owner side is always many-to-one.
It means that the class that uses `@ManyToOne` will store the id of the related object.

After you run the application, the ORM will create the `author` table:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                          author                         |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

It will also modify the `photo` table, adding a new `author` column and creating a foreign key for it:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
| description | varchar(255) |                            |
| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |
| isPublished | boolean      |                            |
| authorId    | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Creating a many-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo can be in many albums, and each album can contain many photos.
Let's create an `Album` class:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    Column,
    ManyToMany,
    JoinTable,
} from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Album {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @ManyToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.albums)
    @JoinTable()
    photos: Photo[]
}
```

`@JoinTable` is required to specify that this is the owner side of the relationship.

Now let's add the inverse side of our relation to the `Photo` class:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    // ... other columns

    @ManyToMany(() => Album, (album) => album.photos)
    albums: Album[]
}
```

After you run the application, the ORM will create a **album_photos_photo_albums** _junction table_:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                album_photos_photo_albums                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| album_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
| photo_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

Don't forget to register the `Album` class with your connection in the ORM:

```javascript
const options: DataSourceOptions = {
    // ... other options
    entities: [Photo, PhotoMetadata, Author, Album],
}
```

Now let's insert albums and photos to our database:

```javascript
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

// create a few albums
const album1 = new Album()
album1.name = "Bears"
await AppDataSource.manager.save(album1)

const album2 = new Album()
album2.name = "Me"
await AppDataSource.manager.save(album2)

// create a few photos
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true
photo.albums = [album1, album2]
await AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)

// now our photo is saved and albums are attached to it
// now lets load them:
const loadedPhoto = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo).findOne({
    where: {
        id: 1,
    },
    relations: {
        albums: true,
    },
})
```

`loadedPhoto` will be equal to:

```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    name: "Me and Bears",
    description: "I am near polar bears",
    filename: "photo-with-bears.jpg",
    albums: [{
        id: 1,
        name: "Bears"
    }, {
        id: 2,
        name: "Me"
    }]
}
```

### Using QueryBuilder

You can use QueryBuilder to build SQL queries of almost any complexity. For example, you can do this:

```javascript
const photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
    .createQueryBuilder("photo") // first argument is an alias. Alias is what you are selecting - photos. You must specify it.
    .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
    .leftJoinAndSelect("photo.albums", "album")
    .where("photo.isPublished = true")
    .andWhere("(photo.name = :photoName OR photo.name = :bearName)")
    .orderBy("photo.id", "DESC")
    .skip(5)
    .take(10)
    .setParameters({ photoName: "My", bearName: "Mishka" })
    .getMany()
```

This query selects all published photos with "My" or "Mishka" names.
It will select results from position 5 (pagination offset)
and will select only 10 results (pagination limit).
The selection result will be ordered by id in descending order.
The photo's albums will be left joined and their metadata will be inner joined.

You'll use the query builder in your application a lot.
Learn more about QueryBuilder [here](./docs/select-query-builder.md).

TypeORM is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms
and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8).
Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features
that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from
small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications
with multiple databases.

TypeORM supports both [Active Record](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) and [Data Mapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) patterns,
unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence,
which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable,
maintainable applications the most productive way.

TypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/),
[Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

## Features

-   Supports both [DataMapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) and [ActiveRecord](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) (your choice).
-   Entities and columns.
-   Database-specific column types.
-   Entity manager.
-   Repositories and custom repositories.
-   Clean object relational model.
-   Associations (relations).
-   Eager and lazy relations.
-   Uni-directional, bi-directional and self-referenced relations.
-   Supports multiple inheritance patterns.
-   Cascades.
-   Indices.
-   Transactions.
-   Migrations and automatic migrations generation.
-   Connection pooling.
-   Replication.
-   Using multiple database instances.
-   Working with multiple databases types.
-   Cross-database and cross-schema queries.
-   Elegant-syntax, flexible and powerful QueryBuilder.
-   Left and inner joins.
-   Proper pagination for queries using joins.
-   Query caching.
-   Streaming raw results.
-   Logging.
-   Listeners and subscribers (hooks).
-   Supports closure table pattern.
-   Schema declaration in models or separate configuration files.
-   Supports MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / CockroachDB / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / SAP Hana / sql.js.
-   Supports MongoDB NoSQL database.
-   Works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / React Native / NativeScript / Expo / Electron platforms.
-   TypeScript and JavaScript support.
-   ESM and CommonJS support.
-   Produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable.
-   Follows all possible best practices.
-   CLI.

And more...

With TypeORM your models look like this:

```javascript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    firstName: string

    @Column()
    lastName: string

    @Column()
    age: number
}
```

And your domain logic looks like this:

```javascript
const userRepository = MyDataSource.getRepository(User)

const user = new User()
user.firstName = "Timber"
user.lastName = "Saw"
user.age = 25
await userRepository.save(user)

const allUsers = await userRepository.find()
const firstUser = await userRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
}) // find by id
const timber = await userRepository.findOneBy({
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Saw",
}) // find by firstName and lastName

await userRepository.remove(timber)
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use the `ActiveRecord` implementation, you can use it as well:

```javascript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, BaseEntity } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class User extends BaseEntity {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    firstName: string

    @Column()
    lastName: string

    @Column()
    age: number
}
```

And your domain logic will look this way:

```javascript
const user = new User()
user.firstName = "Timber"
user.lastName = "Saw"
user.age = 25
await user.save()

const allUsers = await User.find()
const firstUser = await User.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
const timber = await User.findOneBy({
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Saw"
})

await timber.remove()
```

## Installation

1. Install the npm package:

    `npm install typeorm --save`

2. You need to install `reflect-metadata` shim:

    `npm install reflect-metadata --save`

    and import it somewhere in the global place of your app (for example in `app.ts`):

    `import "reflect-metadata"`

3. You may need to install node typings:

    `npm install @types/node --save-dev`

4. Install a database driver:

    - for **MySQL** or **MariaDB**

        `npm install mysql --save` (you can install `mysql2` instead as well)

    - for **PostgreSQL** or **CockroachDB**

        `npm install pg --save`

    - for **SQLite**

        `npm install sqlite3 --save`

    - for **Microsoft SQL Server**

        `npm install mssql --save`

    - for **sql.js**

        `npm install sql.js --save`

    - for **Oracle**

        `npm install oracledb --save`

        To make the Oracle driver work, you need to follow the installation instructions from
        [their](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb) site.

    - for **SAP Hana**

        ```
        npm install @sap/hana-client
        npm install hdb-pool
        ```

        _SAP Hana support made possible by the sponsorship of [Neptune Software](https://www.neptune-software.com/)._

    - for **Google Cloud Spanner**

        ```
        npm install @google-cloud/spanner --save
        ```

        Provide authentication credentials to your application code
        by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:

        ```shell
        # Linux/macOS
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

        # Windows
        set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=KEY_PATH

        # Replace KEY_PATH with the path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.
        ```

        To use Spanner with the emulator you should set `SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable:

        ```shell
        # Linux/macOS
        export SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010

        # Windows
        set SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010
        ```

    - for **MongoDB** (experimental)

        `npm install mongodb@^3.6.0 --save`

    - for **NativeScript**, **react-native** and **Cordova**

        Check [documentation of supported platforms](./docs/supported-platforms.md)

    Install only _one_ of them, depending on which database you use.

##### TypeScript configuration

Also, make sure you are using TypeScript version **4.5** or higher,
and you have enabled the following settings in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
"experimentalDecorators": true,
```

You may also need to enable `es6` in the `lib` section of compiler options, or install `es6-shim` from `@types`.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with TypeORM is to use its CLI commands to generate a starter project.
Quick start works only if you are using TypeORM in a NodeJS application.
If you are using other platforms, proceed to the [step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide).

To create a new project using CLI, run the following command:

```shell
npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres
```

Where `name` is the name of your project and `database` is the database you'll use.
Database can be one of the following values: `mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `sap`, `spanner`, `oracle`, `mongodb`,
`cordova`, `react-native`, `expo`, `nativescript`.

This command will generate a new project in the `MyProject` directory with the following files:

```
MyProject
├── src                   // place of your TypeScript code
│   ├── entity            // place where your entities (database models) are stored
│   │   └── User.ts       // sample entity
│   ├── migration         // place where your migrations are stored
│   ├── data-source.ts    // data source and all connection configuration
│   └── index.ts          // start point of your application
├── .gitignore            // standard gitignore file
├── package.json          // node module dependencies
├── README.md             // simple readme file
└── tsconfig.json         // TypeScript compiler options
```

> You can also run `typeorm init` on an existing node project, but be careful - it may override some files you already have.

The next step is to install new project dependencies:

```shell
cd MyProject
npm install
```

After you have all dependencies installed, edit the `data-source.ts` file and put your own database connection configuration options in there:

```ts
export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    username: "test",
    password: "test",
    database: "test",
    synchronize: true,
    logging: true,
    entities: [Post, Category],
    subscribers: [],
    migrations: [],
})
```

Particularly, most of the time you'll only need to configure
`host`, `username`, `password`, `database` and maybe `port` options.

Once you finish with configuration and all node modules are installed, you can run your application:

```shell
npm start
```

That's it, your application should successfully run and insert a new user into the database.
You can continue to work with this project and integrate other modules you need and start
creating more entities.

> You can generate an ESM project by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --module esm` command.

> You can generate an even more advanced project with express installed by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database mysql --express` command.

> You can generate a docker-compose file by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --docker` command.

## Step-by-Step Guide

What are you expecting from ORM?
First of all, you are expecting it will create database tables for you
and find / insert / update / delete your data without the pain of
having to write lots of hardly maintainable SQL queries.
This guide will show you how to set up TypeORM from scratch and make it do what you are expecting from an ORM.

### Create a model

Working with a database starts from creating tables.
How do you tell TypeORM to create a database table?
The answer is - through the models.
Your models in your app are your database tables.

For example, you have a `Photo` model:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    id: number
    name: string
    description: string
    filename: string
    views: number
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

And you want to store photos in your database.
To store things in the database, first, you need a database table,
and database tables are created from your models.
Not all models, but only those you define as _entities_.

### Create an entity

_Entity_ is your model decorated by an `@Entity` decorator.
A database table will be created for such models.
You work with entities everywhere in TypeORM.
You can load/insert/update/remove and perform other operations with them.

Let's make our `Photo` model an entity:

```javascript
import { Entity } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    id: number
    name: string
    description: string
    filename: string
    views: number
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Now, a database table will be created for the `Photo` entity and we'll be able to work with it anywhere in our app.
We have created a database table, however, what table can exist without columns?
Let's create few columns in our database table.

### Adding table columns

To add database columns, you simply need to decorate an entity's properties you want to make into a column
with a `@Column` decorator.

```javascript
import { Entity, Column } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @Column()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Now `id`, `name`, `description`, `filename`, `views` and `isPublished` columns will be added to the `photo` table.
Column types in the database are inferred from the property types you used, e.g.
`number` will be converted into `integer`, `string` into `varchar`, `boolean` into `bool`, etc.
But you can use any column type your database supports by explicitly specifying a column type into the `@Column` decorator.

We generated a database table with columns, but there is one thing left.
Each database table must have a column with a primary key.

### Creating a primary column

Each entity **must** have at least one primary key column.
This is a requirement and you can't avoid it.
To make a column a primary key, you need to use the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator.

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

### Creating an auto-generated column

Now, let's say you want your id column to be auto-generated (this is known as auto-increment / sequence / serial / generated identity column).
To do that, you need to change the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator to a `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorator:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

### Column data types

Next, let's fix our data types. By default, the string is mapped to a varchar(255)-like type (depending on the database type).
The number is mapped to an integer-like type (depending on the database type).
We don't want all our columns to be limited varchars or integers.
Let's setup correct data types:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column({
        length: 100,
    })
    name: string

    @Column("text")
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column("double")
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Column types are database-specific.
You can set any column type your database supports.
More information on supported column types can be found [here](./docs/entities.md#column-types).

### Creating a new `DataSource`

Now, when our entity is created, let's create `index.ts` file and set up our `DataSource` there:

```javascript
import "reflect-metadata"
import { DataSource } from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"

const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    username: "root",
    password: "admin",
    database: "test",
    entities: [Photo],
    synchronize: true,
    logging: false,
})

// to initialize initial connection with the database, register all entities
// and "synchronize" database schema, call "initialize()" method of a newly created database
// once in your application bootstrap
AppDataSource.initialize()
    .then(() => {
        // here you can start to work with your database
    })
    .catch((error) => console.log(error))
```

We are using Postgres in this example, but you can use any other supported database.
To use another database, simply change the `type` in the options to the database type you are using:
`mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `oracle`, `sap`, `spanner`, `cordova`, `nativescript`, `react-native`,
`expo`, or `mongodb`.
Also make sure to use your own host, port, username, password and database settings.

We added our Photo entity to the list of entities for this data source.
Each entity you are using in your connection must be listed there.

Setting `synchronize` makes sure your entities will be synced with the database, every time you run the application.

### Running the application

Now if you run your `index.ts`, a connection with the database will be initialized and a database table for your photos will be created.

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(100) |                            |
| description | text         |                            |
| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |
| views       | int(11)      |                            |
| isPublished | boolean      |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Creating and inserting a photo into the database

Now let's create a new photo to save it in the database:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

await AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)
console.log("Photo has been saved. Photo id is", photo.id)
```

Once your entity is saved it will get a newly generated id.
`save` method returns an instance of the same object you pass to it.
It's not a new copy of the object, it modifies its "id" and returns it.

### Using Entity Manager

We just created a new photo and saved it in the database.
We used `EntityManager` to save it.
Using entity manager you can manipulate any entity in your app.
For example, let's load our saved entity:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const savedPhotos = await AppDataSource.manager.find(Photo)
console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos)
```

`savedPhotos` will be an array of Photo objects with the data loaded from the database.

Learn more about EntityManager [here](./docs/working-with-entity-manager.md).

### Using Repositories

Now let's refactor our code and use `Repository` instead of `EntityManager`.
Each entity has its own repository which handles all operations with its entity.
When you deal with entities a lot, Repositories are more convenient to use than EntityManagers:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)

await photoRepository.save(photo)
console.log("Photo has been saved")

const savedPhotos = await photoRepository.find()
console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos)
```

Learn more about Repository [here](./docs/working-with-repository.md).

### Loading from the database

Let's try more load operations using the Repository:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const allPhotos = await photoRepository.find()
console.log("All photos from the db: ", allPhotos)

const firstPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
console.log("First photo from the db: ", firstPhoto)

const meAndBearsPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    name: "Me and Bears",
})
console.log("Me and Bears photo from the db: ", meAndBearsPhoto)

const allViewedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ views: 1 })
console.log("All viewed photos: ", allViewedPhotos)

const allPublishedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ isPublished: true })
console.log("All published photos: ", allPublishedPhotos)

const [photos, photosCount] = await photoRepository.findAndCount()
console.log("All photos: ", photos)
console.log("Photos count: ", photosCount)
```

### Updating in the database

Now let's load a single photo from the database, update it and save it:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photoToUpdate = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
photoToUpdate.name = "Me, my friends and polar bears"
await photoRepository.save(photoToUpdate)
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be updated in the database.

### Removing from the database

Now let's remove our photo from the database:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photoToRemove = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
await photoRepository.remove(photoToRemove)
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be removed from the database.

### Creating a one-to-one relation

Let's create a one-to-one relationship with another class.
Let's create a new class in `PhotoMetadata.ts`. This PhotoMetadata class is supposed to contain our photo's additional meta-information:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column("int")
    height: number

    @Column("int")
    width: number

    @Column()
    orientation: string

    @Column()
    compressed: boolean

    @Column()
    comment: string

    @OneToOne(() => Photo)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo
}
```

Here, we are using a new decorator called `@OneToOne`. It allows us to create a one-to-one relationship between two entities.
`type => Photo` is a function that returns the class of the entity with which we want to make our relationship.
We are forced to use a function that returns a class, instead of using the class directly, because of the language specifics.
We can also write it as `() => Photo`, but we use `type => Photo` as a convention to increase code readability.
The type variable itself does not contain anything.

We also add a `@JoinColumn` decorator, which indicates that this side of the relationship will own the relationship.
Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Only one side of relational can be owning.
Using `@JoinColumn` decorator is required on the owner side of the relationship.

If you run the app, you'll see a newly generated table, and it will contain a column with a foreign key for the photo relation:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                     photo_metadata                      |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| height      | int(11)      |                            |
| width       | int(11)      |                            |
| comment     | varchar(255) |                            |
| compressed  | boolean      |                            |
| orientation | varchar(255) |                            |
| photoId     | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Save a one-to-one relation

Now let's save a photo, its metadata and attach them to each other.

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"

// create a photo
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

// create a photo metadata
const metadata = new PhotoMetadata()
metadata.height = 640
metadata.width = 480
metadata.compressed = true
metadata.comment = "cybershoot"
metadata.orientation = "portrait"
metadata.photo = photo // this way we connect them

// get entity repositories
const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const metadataRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(PhotoMetadata)

// first we should save a photo
await photoRepository.save(photo)

// photo is saved. Now we need to save a photo metadata
await metadataRepository.save(metadata)

// done
console.log(
    "Metadata is saved, and the relation between metadata and photo is created in the database too",
)
```

### Inverse side of the relationship

Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Currently, our relation between PhotoMetadata and Photo is unidirectional.
The owner of the relation is PhotoMetadata, and Photo doesn't know anything about PhotoMetadata.
This makes it complicated to access PhotoMetadata from the Photo side.
To fix this issue we should add an inverse relation, and make relations between PhotoMetadata and Photo bidirectional.
Let's modify our entities:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo
}
```

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne } from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)
    metadata: PhotoMetadata
}
```

`photo => photo.metadata` is a function that returns the name of the inverse side of the relation.
Here we show that the metadata property of the Photo class is where we store PhotoMetadata in the Photo class.
Instead of passing a function that returns a property of the photo, you could alternatively simply pass a string to `@OneToOne` decorator, like `"metadata"`.
But we used this function-typed approach to make our refactoring easier.

Note that we should use the `@JoinColumn` decorator only on one side of a relation.
Whichever side you put this decorator on will be the owning side of the relationship.
The owning side of a relationship contains a column with a foreign key in the database.

### Relations in ESM projects

If you use ESM in your TypeScript project, you should use the `Relation` wrapper type in relation properties to avoid circular dependency issues.
Let's modify our entities:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
    Relation,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Relation<Photo>
}
```

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    Relation,
} from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)
    metadata: Relation<PhotoMetadata>
}
```

### Loading objects with their relations

Now let's load our photo and its photo metadata in a single query.
There are two ways to do it - using `find*` methods or using `QueryBuilder` functionality.
Let's use `find*` methods first.
`find*` methods allow you to specify an object with the `FindOneOptions` / `FindManyOptions` interface.

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photos = await photoRepository.find({
    relations: {
        metadata: true,
    },
})
```

Here, photos will contain an array of photos from the database, and each photo will contain its photo metadata.
Learn more about Find Options in [this documentation](./docs/find-options.md).

Using find options is good and dead simple, but if you need a more complex query, you should use `QueryBuilder` instead.
`QueryBuilder` allows more complex queries to be used in an elegant way:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
    .createQueryBuilder("photo")
    .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
    .getMany()
```

`QueryBuilder` allows the creation and execution of SQL queries of almost any complexity.
When you work with `QueryBuilder`, think like you are creating an SQL query.
In this example, "photo" and "metadata" are aliases applied to selected photos.
You use aliases to access columns and properties of the selected data.

### Using cascades to automatically save related objects

We can set up cascade options in our relations, in the cases when we want our related object to be saved whenever the other object is saved.
Let's change our photo's `@OneToOne` decorator a bit:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    // ... other columns

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (metadata) => metadata.photo, {
        cascade: true,
    })
    metadata: PhotoMetadata
}
```

Using `cascade` allows us not to separately save photo and separately save metadata objects now.
Now we can simply save a photo object, and the metadata object will be saved automatically because of cascade options.

```javascript
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

// create photo object
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.isPublished = true

// create photo metadata object
const metadata = new PhotoMetadata()
metadata.height = 640
metadata.width = 480
metadata.compressed = true
metadata.comment = "cybershoot"
metadata.orientation = "portrait"

photo.metadata = metadata // this way we connect them

// get repository
const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)

// saving a photo also save the metadata
await photoRepository.save(photo)

console.log("Photo is saved, photo metadata is saved too.")
```

Notice that we now set the photo's `metadata` property, instead of the metadata's `photo` property as before. The `cascade` feature only works if you connect the photo to its metadata from the photo's side. If you set the metadata's side, the metadata would not be saved automatically.

### Creating a many-to-one / one-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-one/one-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo has one author, and each author can have many photos.
First, let's create an `Author` class:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToMany,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class Author {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @OneToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.author) // note: we will create author property in the Photo class below
    photos: Photo[]
}
```

`Author` contains an inverse side of a relation.
`OneToMany` is always an inverse side of the relation, and it can't exist without `ManyToOne` on the other side of the relation.

Now let's add the owner side of the relation into the Photo entity:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne } from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"
import { Author } from "./Author"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @ManyToOne(() => Author, (author) => author.photos)
    author: Author
}
```

In many-to-one / one-to-many relation, the owner side is always many-to-one.
It means that the class that uses `@ManyToOne` will store the id of the related object.

After you run the application, the ORM will create the `author` table:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                          author                         |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

It will also modify the `photo` table, adding a new `author` column and creating a foreign key for it:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
| description | varchar(255) |                            |
| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |
| isPublished | boolean      |                            |
| authorId    | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Creating a many-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo can be in many albums, and each album can contain many photos.
Let's create an `Album` class:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    Column,
    ManyToMany,
    JoinTable,
} from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Album {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @ManyToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.albums)
    @JoinTable()
    photos: Photo[]
}
```

`@JoinTable` is required to specify that this is the owner side of the relationship.

Now let's add the inverse side of our relation to the `Photo` class:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    // ... other columns

    @ManyToMany(() => Album, (album) => album.photos)
    albums: Album[]
}
```

After you run the application, the ORM will create a **album_photos_photo_albums** _junction table_:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                album_photos_photo_albums                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| album_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
| photo_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

Don't forget to register the `Album` class with your connection in the ORM:

```javascript
const options: DataSourceOptions = {
    // ... other options
    entities: [Photo, PhotoMetadata, Author, Album],
}
```

Now let's insert albums and photos to our database:

```javascript
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

// create a few albums
const album1 = new Album()
album1.name = "Bears"
await AppDataSource.manager.save(album1)

const album2 = new Album()
album2.name = "Me"
await AppDataSource.manager.save(album2)

// create a few photos
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true
photo.albums = [album1, album2]
await AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)

// now our photo is saved and albums are attached to it
// now lets load them:
const loadedPhoto = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo).findOne({
    where: {
        id: 1,
    },
    relations: {
        albums: true,
    },
})
```

`loadedPhoto` will be equal to:

```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    name: "Me and Bears",
    description: "I am near polar bears",
    filename: "photo-with-bears.jpg",
    albums: [{
        id: 1,
        name: "Bears"
    }, {
        id: 2,
        name: "Me"
    }]
}
```

### Using QueryBuilder

You can use QueryBuilder to build SQL queries of almost any complexity. For example, you can do this:

```javascript
const photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
    .createQueryBuilder("photo") // first argument is an alias. Alias is what you are selecting - photos. You must specify it.
    .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
    .leftJoinAndSelect("photo.albums", "album")
    .where("photo.isPublished = true")
    .andWhere("(photo.name = :photoName OR photo.name = :bearName)")
    .orderBy("photo.id", "DESC")
    .skip(5)
    .take(10)
    .setParameters({ photoName: "My", bearName: "Mishka" })
    .getMany()
```

This query selects all published photos with "My" or "Mishka" names.
It will select results from position 5 (pagination offset)
and will select only 10 results (pagination limit).
The selection result will be ordered by id in descending order.
The photo's albums will be left joined and their metadata will be inner joined.

You'll use the query builder in your application a lot.
Learn more about QueryBuilder [here](./docs/select-query-builder.md).
